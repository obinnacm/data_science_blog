## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

My intention in this project was to determine what technology skills are the most popular among high earning developers using Stack Overflow developers survey 2022. The income band focus on was six figure earner. Irrespective of developers demographics, intending developers can get an overview of the most rewarding skills and developers upskilling can better decide what tech skill to invest in.
